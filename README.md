# Gradle and Maven Integration
If you are using Gradle as your build tool, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'net.jacobpeterson', name: 'iqfeed4j', version: '6.2-1.0'
}
```

If you are using Maven as your build tool, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.jacobpeterson</groupId>
    <artifactId>iqfeed4j</artifactId>
    <version>6.2-1.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Note that you don't have to use the Maven Central artifacts and instead can just install a clone of this project to your local Maven repository as shown in the [Building](#building) section.

# Configuration
Creating an `iqfeed4j.properties` file on the classpath with the following format allows you to easily load properties using the `IQFeed4j()` default constructor:
```
application_version=1.0
autoconnect=true
save_login_info=true

feed_name=IQFeed4j
feed_hostname=localhost
level_1_feed_port=5009
market_depth_feed_port=9200
derivative_feed_port=9400
admin_feed_port=9300
lookup_feed_port=9100
```
The default values for `iqfeed4j.properties` can be found [here](https://github.com/Petersoj/IQFeed4j/blob/6.2/src/main/resources/iqfeed4j.default.properties).

# Logging
For logging, this library uses [SLF4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) which serves as an interface for various logging frameworks. This enables you to use whatever logging framework you would like. However, if you do not add a logging framework as a dependency in your project, the console will output a message stating that SLF4j is defaulting to a no-operation (NOP) logger implementation. To enable logging, add a logging framework of your choice as a dependency to your project such as [Log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html), [SLF4j-simple](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html), or [Apache Commons Logging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/).
